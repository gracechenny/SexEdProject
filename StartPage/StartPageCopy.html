<p id='newtext'>What is the state of your sex education?</p>

<div id='paragraphtext'> The United States does not have a unified national curicula for sex education. Wide disparity in access to reliable, safe sex education in states.
<br><br>
The consequences of inadequate sex education are very real. States that have shitty sex education have the highest STD rates.
Our site will visualize the disparity in sexual health curriculum across the United States, raising awareness for the lack of education on this public health issue.
We want our audience to come away with a heightened awareness that there is no federally mandated sexual health curriculum. The content taught is entirely subjective by state. States will omit information, or sometimes teach oppositional messages, generating a partisan information gap.
