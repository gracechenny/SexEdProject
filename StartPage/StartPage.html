  Although sex education is federally funded, the curricula requirements are not federally mandated. Each state government has total discretion over what is taught and how. On April 1st, the Guttmacher Institute published a study in which they detailed the requirements of each state’s sex education programs. We decided to quantify this data to and compile it into composite scores, which we used to rank the states numerically, according to quality of sex ed curricula. Some requirements, like mandating the information taught be medically accurate, can be easily judged as being good or bad. However, there are some requirements, like “must be age appropriate”, that do not have immediately evident motives. While we would all hope that sex education should be age appropriate, this grants individual schools and teachers discretion on what falls within or outside of that category, affording more opportunity for discrimination and bias.

  This map is a visualization of the quality of sex education curricula by state, determined through our analysis of the Guttmacher Institute’s data. Dark blue represents the highest quality curricula. The lighter the color blue of the state, the less inclusive and accurate information they provide. Click on your state to discover what is and isn’t required of your federally funded sex education programs as of spring 2020. We hope this visualization will energetically communicate the disparity in access to sexual health information, instigating discourse around the repercussions of this reality. If this project causes you to reassess your education and inspires you to seek supplementation from available, medically accurate resources, consider exploring Planned Parenthood’s website.
